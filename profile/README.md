# ZenClass Engineering - Hi ðŸ‘‹

Hi everyone, Iâ€™m Rodgers, the CTO and co-founder of ZenKlass.

Weâ€™re an adaptive learning platform that empowers educators with a super easy-to-use interface. Our platform streamlines the teaching experience by focusing on the educator-learner connection. We believe that every educator has their own unique teaching methodology, and thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve made ZenKlass adaptable to any teaching style. Teach in your way with ZenKlass!

## ZenKlass System:

### Our back
We want our server to be safe and efficient while also being easy to develop. To achieve this, we have chosen the following technologies:

- Base: `Rust`, `Postgres`, `Redis`.
- We use `async-graphql` to declare interfaces for clients in an easy way, and `diesel-rs` to work with the database and control migration flow.
- For concurrency, we use `actix` (Actor Model) to use resources efficiently.


### Our front

We believe that the client changes faster than the server-side, such as changes to UI-UX, system design, and more. Therefore, we have chosen the following technologies based on community support:

- Website: `ReactJs`, `NextJs`
- Mobile: `React Native`

## Team
We're a small and lean team - young and talented engineers.
